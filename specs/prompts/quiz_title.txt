You receive a list of questions in an academic quiz. 
The questions follow a JSON format including metadata.
Give a title to the quiz, which effectively summaryses the key topics covered, 
so that it is straightforward to understand once one has to browse among past quizzes.

Return your response in the format:

    "title": "..."
